# Quakkr
Typical posts-comments rails app, for fun.

Try it out: http://quakkr.herokuapp.com  
*Give it a few seconds, Heroku needs to spin up a new dyno :)

```
Notes:  
- Use a dot env file at the root directory based on the example one.
- Use Foreman to start the server.
- No need to install Postgres if starting with development mode. Will resort to using Sqlite on 'db' directory.
```
